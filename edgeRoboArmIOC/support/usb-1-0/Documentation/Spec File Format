#A Spec file contains a list of lines defining the links between asyn parameters
#and the data that the USB device sends.

#A simple definition looks like the following:
TEST_NAME [0,3] -> Int32

#This defines a parameter called TEST_NAME as the Integer created from reading
#the first four bytes of the transferred data.

#You can use as much or as little white space as you want
TEST_2[4]->Int32
TEST_3   [5,  6]   ->   Int32


#Other supported types:

#UInt32
TEST_SCALAR [7] -> UInt32

#UInt32Digital
TEST_BUTTON [8] -> UInt32Digital

#Int8Array (Creates an array of length 4)
TEST_8ARRAY [9, 12] -> Int8Array

#Int16Array (Creates an array of length 2)
TEST_16ARRAY [14, 17] -> Int16Array

#Int32Array (Creates an array of length 2)
TEST_32ARRAY [18, 25] -> Int32Array

#Float64	
TEST_FLOAT [26, 33] -> Float64

#Float32Array (Creates an array of length 2)
TEST_32FARRAY [34, 41] -> Float32Array

#Float64Array (Creates an array of length 2)
TEST_64FARRAY [42, 57] -> Float64Array


#There are two optional definitions that are supported 
#by some types

#Masks, to segregate data that resides in the same byte
#    Supported by: Int32, UInt32, UInt32Digital
TEST_BUTTON2 [58] -> UInt32Digital /0x01
TEST_BUTTON3 [58] -> UInt32Digital /0x08


#And shifts, to align data to a correct representation
TEST_UPPER_HALF [59] >> 4 -> Int32 /0x0F

#Shifts are applied first, so remember to write your masks accordingly



#Definitions don't need to be in sequence
TEST_BUTTON4 [13] -> UInt32Digital /0x10
