usbSetFrequency
	Sets the frequency at which the driver reads values from the device. Most
	USB devices work at 125hz.

	const char* port_name
		The port name the driver is operating under

	double frequency
		The frequency (in hertz) you wish the driver to operate at.


usbSetDebugLevel
	Sets the debug level for output from the driver.

	const char* port_name 
		The port name the driver is operating under

	int amt
		The debug level


usbSetInterface
	Sets the interface of the USB device that the driver claims. Some devices
	expose multiple interfaces (like a nano usb transceiver would expose an
	interface for a wireless mouse and one for a wireless keyboard), so you can
	choose and switch between them. Information on interfaces can be found using
	the command 'lsusb -v'.

	const char* port_name
		The port name the driver is operating under

	int interface_num
		The number of the interface


usbSetDelay
	Sets the amount of time a driver should wait between attempts to reconnect
	to a device after a disconnection event.
 
	const char* port_name
		The port name the driver is operating under

	double delay
		The amount of time to wait


usbSetTimeout
	Sets the maximum amount of time a driver should wait for a usb data packet.

	const char* port_name
		The port name the driver is operating under

	int timeout
		The timeout


void usbConnectDevice
	Tells the driver to attempt to connect to a USB device with the given
	specifications. If already connected to a device, it will disconnect from
	that device before connecting to another. Information about these values
	can be found using the command 'lsusb -v'.

	const char* port_name
		The port name the driver is operating under

	int interface_num
		The interface of the device to claim

	int vendor_id
		The vendor id of the device

	int product_id
		The product id of the device

	const char* serial_num
		The serial "number" of the device (USB specification doesn't require this
		to be an actual number). If not given, the driver will connect to the
		first device that matches the other parameters.


void usbCreateDriver
	Creates the driver object that will maintain the asyn parameters necessary
	for communicating with USB devices.

	const char* port_name
		The port name the driver should operate under

	const char* input_filename
		A specification file detailing the structure of data packets coming in
		from the USB device. Along with the output file, this will define the
		asyn parameters for use in EPICS.

	const char* output_filename
		A specification file detailing the structure of data packets going out
		to the USB device. This is an optional parameter as not all devices will
		handle output requests.
