APS 11-BM: A real automation robot
==================================

The Advanced Photon Source beam line 11-BM sample change robot is
an example of a real automation robot for X-ray science.  This robot
has more motorized axes, positione encoders, and limit switches.
The mechanical system has much lower backlash and higher lifting strength.

Also, the system has a bar code reader to identify samples before they
are mounted on the instrument.
