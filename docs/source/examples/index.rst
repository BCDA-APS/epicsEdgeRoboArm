There are two examples to demonstrate the EPICS control of the OWI Edge Robotic Arm.
For comparison, an additional example shows the sample changing robot at 
Advanced Photon Source beam line 11-BM.  That robot, also under EPICS control, 
is several axes in common with the OWI Edge Robotic Arm.
But, the 11-BM robot is far more advanced, including more 
rotation axes such as wrist twist.
